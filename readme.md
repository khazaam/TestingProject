[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/khazaam/TestingProject/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/khazaam/TestingProject?branch=master)

This is just a readme file.

test folder contains tests, more a unit tests.

I am not entirely sure can we do integration tests, we do not have a server to test and frontend.
